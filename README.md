# AI-Fall-Quarter-Workshop

ACM AI's Fall Quarter Workshops met for 2 hours every week (20 hours) to cover Machine Learning (ML) theory, ethical case studies in AI, and practical coding sessions.

Shoutout to Venkat, Jackson, Gregor, and Jordan for instructing us! You guys are passionate and helpful about which professors to avoid. 
I want to one day (next year?) help students like you guys did :) 

I am passionate about learning and this quarter, we covered: KNNs, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Machine Learning Libraries (panda, numpy), Neural Networks and more!
